Lab: Basic Syntax, Conditional Statements and Loops

⦁	Biggest of Three Numbers
Write a program that receives three whole numbers and print the biggest one

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

print(max(a, b, c))

⦁	Number Definer
Write a program that reads a floating-point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero. Otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1 000 000.


number = float(input())

if number == 0:
    print('zero')
elif 1 < number < 1000000:
    print('positive')
elif 0 < number < 1:
    print('small positive')
elif number > 1000000:
    print('large positive')
elif -1 < number < 0:
    print('small negative')
elif -1000000 < number < -1:
    print('negative')
else:
    print('large negative')

⦁	Word Reverse
Write a program that receives a single word from the user, reverses it and prints it
word = input()


for i in range(len(word) - 1, -1, -1):
    print(word[i], end="")

⦁	Number Between 1 and 100
Write a program which reads numbers from the console until it receives a number between 1 and 100 inclusive. When the correct number is received, stop reading and print "The number {number} is between 1 and 100"

number = float(input())

while number < 1 or number > 100:
    number = float(input())

print(f"The number {number} is between 1 and 100")

⦁	Patterns
Write a program to create the following pattern:
 
You will receive a number that represents the highest number of stars.


number = int(input())

for row in range(1, number + 1):
    print(row * '*')
for row in range(number - 1, -1, -1):
    print(row * '*')
